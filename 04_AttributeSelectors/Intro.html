<h3>Attribute selectors</h3>
<ul>
   <li> The CSS Attribute Selector is used to select an element with some specific attribute or attribute value.</li>
   <li> It is an excellent way to style the HTML elements by grouping them based on some specific attributes and the attribute selector will select those elements with similar attributes.</li>

</ul>
    <h3>Types of attribute selectors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
<b>[attribute] Selector:</b> <br> This type of attribute selector is used to select all the elements that have the specified attribute and applies the CSS property to that attribute.</li>
<li><b>[attribute&nbsp;= “value”] Selector:</b> <br> This selector is used to select all the elements whose attribute has the value exactly same as the specified value.</li>
<li><b>[attribute&nbsp;~=”value”] Selector:</b> <br> This selector is used to select all the elements whose attribute value is a list of space-separated values, one of which is exactly equal to the specified value.</li>
<li><b>[attribute&nbsp;|=”value”] Selector:</b> <br> This selector is used to select all the elements whose attribute has a hyphen-separated list of values beginning with the specified value. The value has to be a whole word either alone or followed by a hyphen.</li>
<li><b>[attribute&nbsp;^=”value”] Selector:</b> <br> This selector is used to select all the elements whose attribute value begins with the specified value. The value doesn't need to be a whole word.</li>
<li><b>[attribute&nbsp;$=”value”] Selector:</b> <br> This selector is used to select all the elements whose attribute value ends with the specified value. The value doesn't need to be a whole word.</li>
<li><b>[attribute&nbsp;*=”value”] Selector:</b> <br> This selector selects all the elements whose attribute value contains the specified value present anywhere. The value doesn't need to be a whole word.</li>
</ul>
