    <h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for
            different devices and screen sizes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.With an external stylesheet file, you can
            change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
        </li><br>
        <li> Something else about CSS <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li> When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it
                    started a nightmare for web developers.</li><br>
                <li> Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page,
                    became a long and expensive process.</li><br>
                <li> To solve this problem, the <b> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </b>created CSS.</li><br>
                <li> CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</li><br>
            </ol>
        </li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types of CSS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Inline CSS.</li>
        <li> Internal/ Embedded CSS.</li>
        <li> External CSS.</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Inline CSS:</b> Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached to the element is known as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute.</li>
            <li><b>Internal or Embedded CSS:</b> This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e. the CSS is embedded within the &lt;style&gt; tag inside head section of the HTML file.</li>
            <li><b>External CSS:</b> External CSS contains separate CSS files that contain only style properties with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc). CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. It means that, for each element, style can be set only once and will be applied across web pages.</li>
