    <h3>Pseudo-classes</h3>
<ul>
    <li> A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element.
    </li>
    <li> For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the
        button and this selected button can then be styled.</li>
    <li> A pseudo-class consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., :hover).</li>
    <li> A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parenthesis to define the arguments (e.g., :dir()).</li>
    <li> The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element (e.g., button in case
        button:hover).</li>
    <li> Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree,
    </li>
    <li> But also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (:visited, for example),</li>
    <li> The status of its content (like :checked on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like :hover)</li>
</ul>
