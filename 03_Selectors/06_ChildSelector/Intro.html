    <h3>Child selector</h3>
<ul>
   <li> The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors.</li>
   <li> It matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are the direct children of lements matched by the first.</li>
  <li> Elements matched by the second selector must be the immediate children of the elements matched by the first selecto..</li>
  <li> This is stricter than the descendant combinator, which matches all elements matched by the second selector for which there exists an ancestor element matched by the first selector. </li>
  <li> <b> Example:- </b>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>If, x, y and z are three HTML elements, </li>
        <li> and z resides within start and end tag of y, </li>
        <li> and y resides within start and end tag of x; </li>
        <li> then y is called as a child of x; and z is called as a child of y.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</li>
